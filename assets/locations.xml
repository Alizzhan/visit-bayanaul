For example, this reservoir is considered the cleanest in Kazakhstan. • The infrastructure is not sufficiently developed, so resting in some recreation areas. The time machine will take you back to the Soviet period. Romantic, isn't it? Many holiday homes are clean and cozy, but the living conditions are often Spartan. However, do not be afraid because nature and sincere people compensate."
